# Student Record Management System (CLI-Based)

This is a Java-based command-line interface (CLI) application for managing student records using basic CRUD operations â€” Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

## Features

- Add new student records (ID, Name, Marks)
- View all existing students
- Update student details
- Delete student by ID
- Simple text-based menu system

## Technologies Used

- Java
- ArrayList (Java Collections)
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes, Methods)
- Scanner for user input

Two files Student.java and Main.java are used. The function of Student.java is to provide a blueprint of what values to be entered and also mention the format of the program. Main.java is used to keep the 
records of the students entered in the terminal and run the functions accordingly.

Private access modifier is used as it is a reocrd based system although pulbic access modifier could have been used but it is better to use private to keep the data hidden.
